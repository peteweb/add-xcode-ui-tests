### EPIC DISCLAIMER ###

This is very much a work in progress, and essentially - a proof of concept. If you use this, and it mares your project up - that's your bad - and you should be backing up your files more. Use with caution, and put your head between your legs if required.

Tested only with XCode 7.2.1 - believed to work with 7.3.*.
